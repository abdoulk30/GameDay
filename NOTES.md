## APIs Considered
- **TheSportsDB**: Free, easy for schedules, limited requests
- **API-Sports**: Paid tier, more robust, additional sports features
- **SportsData.io**: Full sports dataset, best for scaling later

## UX / Layout Ideas
- Clean calendar-style layout for NFL weeks
- Monthly grid for NBA games
- Color coding by home/away team
- Search/filter by team or date

## Questions / Decisions
- Should we cache all season schedules or fetch on demand?
- How should weekends vs weekdays be visually distinguished?
- Should favorite teams be highlighted for user personalization?

## References / Inspiration
- ESPN schedule pages (dense but informative)
- League apps (complex, overkill for MVP)
- Minimalist dashboards (easy to scan, uncluttered)
